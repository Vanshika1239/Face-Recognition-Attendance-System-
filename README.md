 
# Face Recognition Attendance System Using Local Binary Pattern Histogram Algorithm

# Abstract

Like other widely used biometric technologies like fingerprint, iris, and finger vein pattern recognition, face recognition is a biometric technique.
The face is the most important part of the human body for recognizing each 
individual because it contains many important features. 
This study creates face classification models, employing HAAR-CASCADE OpenCV for face detection and LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) for face recognition, to identify each character's face from a collected image. 
The suggested facial recognition attendance system will take a picture, compare it to a database-stored picture, and then automatically register attendance.
                           With the advent of the era of big data in the world and the commercial value of face recognition technology, the prospects for face recognition technology are very bright and have great market demand. 
This article aims to design a face recognition attendance system based on real-time video processing.
This article mainly sets four directions to consider the problems: the accuracy rate of the face recognition system in the actual check-in, the stability of the face recognition attendance system with real-time video processing, the truancy rate of the face recognition attendance system with real-time video processing and the interface settings of the face recognition attendance system using real-time video processing. 
By analyzing the situation of these problems, the concept of an attendance system based on face recognition technology is proposed, and research on fa ace recognition attendance system based on real-time video processing is carried out. The face recognition time and attendance system with real-time video processing through the above experimental certification can quickly complete the tasks of students in the time and attendance check-in system, get rid of the complex naming phenomenon, greatly improve the efficiency of class, and play an important role in guiding the development of the time and attendance system.
